Implement Caching for Updating (CachePut) Cartpuller & Rider location as well as for Getting them (Cache)

Add API paths like /api/customer/validateToken, to check validity of token on login page so we dont have to request the token again and again
Also write logic for this in app

Make assgining of order like old app (every 30s the next nearest cartpuller will get the order for grabs, we can do this by making a table and running a backround function and this table will have cartpullerID : List<Order> Map)

Instead of putting 2 strings longitude&latitide use `Point` Object, this will allow us to make geo-spatial queries in mongo

Inside timer (started in init()) instead of calling setState() periodically and refreshing the build() method with future builder, use stream builder (in cartpuller & especially rider app)

Add a permanent warning on order_details_page that the cartpuller location might change when they click on track button, to get updated coordinates of cartpuller come back to our app and click track again

Rider & cartpuller cant deactiavte themselves if they have active orders

Logout button for rider & cartpuller

Ngrok throttles connections per minute try switching to localtunnel.me or throttle the `Timers` use for polling in all the apps
