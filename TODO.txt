Implement Caching for Updating (CachePut) Cartpuller & Rider location as well as for Getting them (Cache)

Add API paths like /api/customer/validateToken, /api/cartpuller/validateToken, /api/rider/validateToken, to check validity of token on login page so we dont have to request the token again and again
Also write logic for this in app

Make assgining of order like old app (every 30s the next nearest cartpuller will get the order for grabs, we can do this by making a table and running a backround function and this table will have cartpullerID : List<Order> Map)

Instead of putting 2 strings longitude&latitide use `Point` Object, this will allow us to make geo-spatial queries in mongo

Add path like /is-cartpuller-active (returns boolean)
